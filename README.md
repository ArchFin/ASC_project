# ASC_project: Hidden Markov Model (HMM) Pipeline for Entropic Mind Analysis

## Overview
This project implements a robust pipeline for analyzing time-series data using a custom Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework. The goal is to uncover hidden states underlying subjective feeling ratings, with a focus on understanding the concept of an "Entropic mind." The pipeline is designed for interpretability, reproducibility, and extensibility.

## Motivation
A HMM is a statistical model that describes a system assumed to be a Markov process with unobserved (hidden) states. It is ideal for time-series data where you observe emissions (outputs) but not the underlying state sequence. This makes HMMs powerful for modeling transitions in psychological or physiological states, such as those hypothesized in altered states of consciousness.

## Pipeline Structure

### 1. Data Input and Preprocessing
- **Input:** CSV file with time-series data (e.g., subjective ratings, conditions, session info).
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Data is split by subject/session/week as needed.
  - Features (feelings) are selected based on configuration.
  - Data is standardized (z-scored) for PCA and clustering.

### 2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Purpose:** Reduce dimensionality and identify main axes of variation in feelings data.
- **Outputs:**
  - Bar plots of principal component loadings (which feelings drive each PC).
  - Scatter plot of data in PC1/PC2 space.
  - Explained variance ratio plot.
- **Rationale:** PCA helps visualize structure and ensures clustering is not dominated by noise or redundant features.

### 3. Custom HMM Clustering
- **Model:**
  - Uses a custom HMM with multivariate t-distribution emissions for robustness to outliers.
  - Includes an extra "transition" state to capture periods of change between stable states.
  - Parameters are initialized with KMeans and refined via EM-like training.
- **Key Decisions:**
  - t-distribution is chosen for its heavy tails, better modeling real-world data.
  - Transition state allows explicit modeling of non-stationary periods.
  - Multiple runs and state alignment ensure stability and reproducibility.

### 4. Visualization and Interpretation
- **State Sequence Plot:** Shows cluster assignment over time.
- **Gamma Heatmap:** Visualizes state membership probabilities (uncertainty, transitions).
- **Transition Matrix:** Heatmap of empirical transition probabilities.
- **State Duration Distribution:** Histogram of how long each state persists.
- **Cluster Feature Profiles:** Bar plots of mean feeling values per cluster.
- **PCA Projections:** Data and cluster centers in PC space.
- **Trajectory Plots:** Feeling time-courses with cluster/state shading and transition annotations.
- **Middle State Validation:** Checks if the dominant cluster matches the "neutral" state (smallest L2 norm).

### 5. Transition and Jump Analysis
- **Transition Annotation:** Each transition is classified as abrupt or gradual based on gamma slope.
- **Transition Metadata:** CSV output with timing, type, and condition frequencies before/during/after transitions.
- **Jump Analysis:**
  - Stability: Ratio of dominant cluster to others as a function of time step (jump).
  - Consistency: Agreement of clustering across downsampling.
  - Autocorrelation: Average ACF for each feeling.

## Outputs
- **CSV files:** Cluster assignments, transition metadata.
- **PNG plots:** All visualizations described above, saved to the configured output directory.
- **Pickle files:** For saving transition data for further analysis.
- **Text files:** Middle state validation results, cluster summaries.

## How to Run
1. **Configure** your settings in `Breathwork.yaml` (file paths, feelings, PCA dimensions, etc).
2. **Run** the main script:
   ```bash
   python HMM.py
   ```
3. **Outputs** will be saved to the specified directory. Review PNGs, CSVs, and text files for results.

## Extending or Modifying the Pipeline
- **Add new features:** Update the feelings list in the YAML and ensure your CSV includes them.
- **Change model parameters:** Adjust number of states, iterations, or t-distribution settings in the YAML or code.
- **Add visualizations:** Extend the `Visualiser` or `CustomHMMClustering` classes.
- **Use with new data:** Ensure your data matches the expected format and update paths in the YAML.

## Rationale for Key Decisions
- **t-distribution emissions:** More robust to outliers than Gaussian.
- **Transition state:** Explicitly models periods of change, improving interpretability.
- **PCA before clustering:** Reduces noise and highlights meaningful structure.
- **Multiple visualizations:** Each plot is chosen to make the model's behavior and results transparent.
- **Middle state validation:** Ensures the dominant cluster is interpretable and not an artifact.
